# VignereCipher
Simple implementation of vignere cipher algorithm .
Note:

  (1) plainTextList , cipherTextList and keyList are just the lists containing the indices of alphabets.
      eg. let, plainText = "back" , then plainTextList = [1, 0, 2, 10] 
      -> index of 'a' = 0 and 'z' = 25 !
  (2) keystream is the string of the length equal to that of plainText or cipherText.
